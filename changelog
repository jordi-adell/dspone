## [0.4.1] - (2017-02-8)

### New
 - travis CI configuration file
 - Implement a clear function in ShortTimepProcess
 - API functions to get FFT in the plain complex format, in addition to CCS format
 - Test dependency on sndfile

### Changed
 - Several unit-tests added
 - changed the API from using std::shared_ptr into boost::share_array

### Fixed
 - Implementation of getRemainingSpeech function in ShortTimeProcess
 - Declaration of virtual function process parameterisation in TimeProcess
 - logger, enabled it by default in DEBUG compilation
 - dithering (sort of) in GCC, also tests added
 - STFT bug due to not denormalising the FFT by the frame length
 - FFT frameLength normalisation
 - using frameLength instead of fftLength in SFTFT

## [0.4.0] - (2016-10-05)

### New

- documentation configuration for doxygen
- MedianFilter
- filters support for int32_t
- SignalPower class with several power calculation functions
- support for SubBandSTFT analysis

### Fixes

- fixed the call to wipp::triangle
- shorttimeprocess inheritage made public

## [0.3.0] - (2016-07-04)

### New
- interface for signal analysis
- support for processing uint16_t signal buffers

### Changes
- redefinition of dsp modules by removing the inheritance from ProcessDispatcher
- removed templates from the public API
- now shorttime and shorttimeanalysis process inherits from shorttimeprocessor
- SigalProcessor converter into a higher level interface

### Fixes
- missing headers for installation

## [0.2.0] - 2016-06-19

### Fixes

- set the correct reference for the preemphasis filter test
- compilation flags depending on DEBUG property
- repaired filter bank tests, removed some debug helpers
- implement the options to choose between rectangular and triangular shape
- change spectral weighting to use complex multiplication
- change the name of the power spcetrum function --> power
- change the order of passing low and high freq to wipp function
- used sqr functions for power 2

### New

- add rectangular filter shape
- added logger
- removed dependency on FFTW because wipp is shared now

### Changes

- files places under subdirectories for clearness
- Separate complex declaration from internal base type declarations
- disable logging for dependant libraries
- move to std::shared_ptr instead of boost::shared_ptr
- short time processors refactor to hide implementations
- hide STFT sub-band analysis implementation
- hide wipp implementation
- hide most boost library usages
- reorganise the real time modules, so that headers are clean and implementation is hidden.
- split header in several modules (algorithm, filter, rt, ...)
- simplified wipp find module

## [0.1.8] - 2014-11-17

- Error check for negative FFT orders
  If order is below 4 (2‚Å¥ = 16 samples) an error is printed.
  However if order is zero or negative, now an exception is thrown becuase
  it is not possible to do anything with these FFT orders.
  This will avoid the hang in refs #10184

## [0.1.7] - 2014-11-10

## [0.1.6] - 2014-10-24

- Patch to avoid errors when processing data channels in the case when
  there are no input channels given, but there are output channels to be generated.

- Test with a constant signal for shorttimeprocess

- Now you can pass more than nchannels to the shorttimeprocess,
  or any of its inherit classes.
  Extra channels are considered datachannels and ar not analysed.
  Each frame can be modified from processParameterisation function
  accessing the _dataFrames structure, in the same way that
  _analysisFrames was used.
